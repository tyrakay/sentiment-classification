# Sentiment Classification Project

## Overview

This project implements a sentiment classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to distinguish between positive and negative movie reviews. The focus is on preprocessing movie review data and building a model that can accurately predict the sentiment of new reviews.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes several steps for cleaning and preparing text data, including:
  - Converting words to lowercase.
  - Removing punctuation.
  - Filtering out common stopwords.

- **Sentiment Classification**: The model is trained on preprocessed reviews to classify them as either positive or negative.

- **Representative Content Word Extraction**: The most frequent words in positive and negative reviews are identified to help understand the distinguishing features of each sentiment.

## Instructions

1. **Candidate Number**: 
   - In the setup section, enter your unique candidate number in the provided cell to ensure a unique dataset is used.
   - Example:
     ```python
     candidateno = 277161
     ```

2. **Library Setup**:
   - Ensure you have all necessary libraries installed, such as `nltk`, which is used for processing the text data.
   - Download the required `nltk` datasets by running the provided setup code.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - The notebook includes helper functions to preprocess the movie reviews:
     - Tokenization of words.
     - Lowercasing and removal of punctuation.
     - Stopword filtering.

4. **Run the Code**:
   - Follow the notebook's structure to implement your sentiment classification logic. You will preprocess the dataset and extract frequent words for positive and negative reviews.

5. **Custom Analysis**:
   - Analyze the preprocessed data to identify patterns in word frequency for positive and negative reviews.
   - Implement additional classification techniques if desired.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **NLTK**: For text processing tasks such as stopword removal and tokenization.

## Running the Notebook

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

2. Download necessary resources:
   In the notebook, ensure that you download the NLTK datasets like `stopwords` and `punkt` by executing:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

3. Follow the cells to preprocess the dataset, extract features, and train a model on the sentiment data.
